Task 3: Guide Questions and Answers

1️⃣ What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?

The readyState property indicates the progress or stage of the request.

0 – UNSENT (Request not initialized)

1 – OPENED (Server connection established)

2 – HEADERS_RECEIVED (Request received)

3 – LOADING (Processing request)

4 – DONE (Request finished and response ready)

The status property indicates the HTTP response code returned by the server, such as:

200 – OK

404 – Not Found

500 – Server Error

✅ In short:
readyState shows how far along the request is, while status shows the result after the request is completed.

2️⃣ How can you make the request asynchronous?
You can make a request asynchronous by setting the third parameter of the xhr.open() method to true, like this:

xhr.open("GET", "https://example.com/data", true);


This allows the web page to continue running other scripts without waiting for the response. If it’s set to false, the request becomes synchronous and will block other operations.

3️⃣ Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?
Asynchronous communication is recommended because it allows the web page to remain responsive while data is being loaded. It improves user experience by:

Letting users interact with the page even while waiting for data.

Updating only specific parts of the page instead of reloading everything.

Making applications faster and more efficient.

Providing a smoother and more dynamic browsing experience.

✅ In summary:
Asynchronous communication makes web applications faster, smoother, and more user-friendly.
