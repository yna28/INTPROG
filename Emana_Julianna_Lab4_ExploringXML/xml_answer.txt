
1. What are the basic rules of XML you applied in this lab?

Some basic XML rules you likely applied include:

XML must have a single root element that encloses all other elements.
Tags must be properly opened and closed (e.g., `<name></name>`).
Tags are case-sensitive, so `<Item>` is different from `<item>`.
Elements must be properly nested — tags cannot overlap.
Attribute values must be quoted (e.g., `<book id="1">`).
XML must be well-formed, meaning it follows all structural rules so a parser can read it.


2. Why does XML need a single root element?

XML needs a single root element because:

 It provides a structured, hierarchical organization for all the data.
 Parsers require one root so they know where the document begins and ends.
 It ensures the entire content is treated as one complete, valid document.
 Without a root, XML becomes ambiguous and cannot be processed correctly.


3. How does XML ensure interoperability?

XML ensures interoperability through:

Platform-independence — XML is plain text, readable by any system.
Unicode support, allowing consistent representation of characters across languages.
Self-describing tags, which make data structure understandable without needing special software.
Standardized syntax, so different applications can exchange data reliably.
Widespread parser support, meaning almost all programming languages and systems can read XML.
